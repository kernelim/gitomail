## Gitomail

Gitomail's automatic E-Mail generation for git provides the following:

* Pretty HTML colored diffs in E-Mails, per commit, *in combination* with the old time plaintext for old E-Mail readers.
* Maintainership tracking: Per-commit `To:` and `Cc:` destinations that correspond to the files being changed.
* Per remote ref change, tell if it's a rebase or a fast-forward, figuring out the base branch *before* the merge.
* Built-in SMTP client.
